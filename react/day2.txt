- Introduction to React:

1. What is React? (Doc: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)
    a. Introduction: React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components.
    b. Developed by: It is by Facebook/Meta.
    c. Latest version: v18.2.0.
    d. Why react?
        - Improved performance: React uses Virtual DOM, thereby creating web applications faster. Virtual DOM compares the components’ previous states and updates only the items in the Real DOM that were changed, instead of updating all of the components again, as conventional web applications do.
        - Reusable components: Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components. These components have their logic and controls, and they can be reused throughout the application, which in turn dramatically reduces the application’s development time.
        - Small learning curve: React is easy to learn, as it mostly combines basic HTML and JavaScript concepts with some beneficial additions. Still, as is the case with other tools and frameworks, you have to spend some time to get a proper understanding of React’s library.
        - It can be used for the development of both web and mobile apps: We already know that React is used for the development of web applications, but that’s not all it can do. There is a framework called React Native, derived from React itself, that is hugely popular and is used for creating beautiful mobile applications. So, in reality, React can be used for making both web and mobile applications.

2. Setting up React Environment - Installing Node.js, npm, and creating a React app using create-react-app
    a. Install and check version of:
        i. Node
        ii. npm
    b. How to create react app: npx create-react-app {my-app}
